# Scripts

Here's some scripts I've created in the past. You may or may not find them useful, but feel free to use and modify as required.

logstash-variable - init script for Logstash. Allows multiple logstash agents to run on a single box.

diskcheck.sh - simple wrapper to throw a warning if a disk is almost full. 

ipblock.sh - scrapes the Linux secure log for failed log in attempts. Blocks users who attempt brute force logins using TCP Wrappers.
